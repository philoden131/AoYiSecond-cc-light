Traction (Proof of PMF):
Product has just completed development and is in late-stage bug fixes, not yet launched to market. Zero users and revenue to date—PMF validation begins with private beta release.

Market & GTM (Go-to-Market):
- ICP (Ideal Customer Profile): 20–30 year old urban female professionals in tier-1/2 cities with steady dressing needs for work and social occasions. They have basic aesthetic pursuit but lack time for continuous research and trial-and-error. Currently relying on repeated outfits, intuition, or scattered content references, they find daily styling decision-making time-consuming and results inconsistent. This group has clear demand for reducing daily outfit decision costs and achieving sustainable styling results, with the ability and willingness to pay for efficiency-driven solutions.

- Pricing: Monthly subscription model. This is the most direct way to validate PMF—high-frequency usage scenarios can cover AI inference costs while establishing predictable recurring revenue. As the user base grows, the Agent's wardrobe data and user profile insights become the foundation for precise recommendations: Phase 2 enables e-commerce commission (users purchase through our styled recommendations), Phase 3 enables brand advertising (brands pay to reach target users through curated outfit content).

- Acquisition Channels: Instagram + TikTok as primary launch channels. Fashion and style are core content categories on both platforms with high audience overlap—young women users are highly concentrated and fashion content drives strong engagement, making these our most precise acquisition channels.

- Why Global Day 1: AI products carry per-query inference costs and cannot follow the traditional internet playbook of subsidizing user acquisition before optimizing LTV—we must enter markets with higher willingness to pay and higher transaction values. Fashion is a universal need requiring no additional market education; AI-enabled solutions can directly scale to high-spending fashion markets including North America and Europe.
