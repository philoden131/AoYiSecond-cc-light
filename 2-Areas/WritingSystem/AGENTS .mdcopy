# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Root is a Markdown knowledge base for 奥一写作系统; keep new docs consistent with existing tone.
- `WriteRule/`: stage-specific playbooks (开头、标题、事实核查等); cite files when updating guidance.
- `other/`: overarching methodology like `0-1写作系统.md`; treat as canonical principles.
- `分平台分发/`: platform tone and rewrite rules; mirror platform-specific additions here.
- `创作原料/`: raw prompts, chat logs, research notes; keep organized, no private data.
- `Output/`: generated drafts/versions; prefer dated subfolders when volume grows.
- `.cursor/rules/`: agent/system prompts; update carefully and keep changes documented.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- No build pipeline; edit Markdown directly.
- `rg "<keyword>"` searches guidance quickly across folders.
- `rg --files -g "*.md" Output` lists produced drafts.
- `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.md` previews structure in PowerShell.
- Use a Markdown preview locally to spot formatting issues.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use Markdown headings in order; prefer short paragraphs and actionable bullets.
- Maintain voice and structure from `other/0-1写作系统.md`; keep language concrete and platform-specific.
- Files are UTF-8; keep existing Chinese filenames, use concise kebab-case English for new ones when clearer.
- Include inline references to related guides (e.g., 链接到对应规则文件) when adding new advice.
- For Output drafts, optionally prefix filenames with date and topic (`20251208-productivity.md`).

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated tests; perform self-review: check headings render, lists align, and links resolve.
- Validate facts per `WriteRule/事实核查与信息增强指南.md`; note sources or cross-links in context.
- Before publishing, re-read against platform tone in `分平台分发/平台调性.md`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages: imperative, ≤72 chars, focused scope (`Add fact-check checklist`, `Update platform tone note`).
- PRs should summarize intent, list touched files, include before/after snippet if wording changes, and link related guides or issues.
- Ask for review when altering canonical rules or `.cursor/rules/` prompts; highlight risks or open questions.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Strip personal data from `创作原料/` and `Output/` before sharing.
- Avoid committing API keys or session data; this repo should contain text only.
- Keep agent instructions in `.cursor/rules/` synchronized with corresponding public guidelines to prevent drift.
